###### More Information as above:

The Easter Bunny myth is believed to have been famous in the nineteenth century.

Rabbits usually have a large litter of babies (known as kittens), so they have become a sign of new life.

According to legend, the Easter Bunny lays, decorates, and hides eggs as a sign of new life.

As a result, some children can find Easter egg hunts to be a fun part of the celebration.

Other symbols in Easter include painting hard boiled eggs (and given to children as gifts), chocolate shapped eggs, and egg hunts.
